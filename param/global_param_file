# State machine description:
# An SM is a collection of states, when every state should be described according to the following pattern:
#
#  *SM Start*
#  State [state number] [isAcceptance]
#  [input value] [next state number]
#  [input value] [next state number]
#  [input value] [next state number]
#  [input value] [next state number]
#  .
#  .
#  .
#
#  *SM End*
#
# Note that unmentioned input possibilities will be treated as self-loops by default (meaning these inputs
# will keep the machine in it's current state). 

*SM Start*

State 1 false
