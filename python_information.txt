To run the python part of the code you need:

1.	python3 (we used Python 3.3.1)
2.	tkinter (python package)
3.	ttk	(python package)
4.	easygui	(python package)

If you want to run the GUI alone: open a terminal ,go to GUI_final_project folder location and type:
	python3 [gui_program_name]
	ex: python3 gui.py

*There is no need to run the gui program this way, because it is started anyway by the cpp part of code (by the Client).
*The only reason to run it would be to make (in test) changes in the GUI.
