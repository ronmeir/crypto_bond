To run the python part of the code you need:

1.	python3 (we used Python 3.3.1)
2.	tkinter (python package)
3.	ttk	(python package)
4.	easygui	(python package)

If you want to run the GUI alone, run it using the Python interpreter:
	python3 [gui_program_name]
	ex: python3 gui.py

*There is no need to run the gui program this way, it is started anyway by the main program (by the Client).
*The only reason to run it would be to make changes to the GUI (Debug and testing).
